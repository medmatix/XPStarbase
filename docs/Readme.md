I think the best summary of the South Texas Launch Site Plans is from [Tesmanian](https://www.tesmanian.com/blogs/tesmanian-blog/spacex-launch-site-map), extracted from an Army Corps of engineers report. I refer to thois regularly.

Also included here are some notifications and regulatory materials I found from FAA and otheer government and local sites.
