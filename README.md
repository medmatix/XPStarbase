# X-Plane-Scenery

Scenery development for simulations, centered on X-Plane flight simulator This is one of a number of projects for [X-plane Scenery](https://github.com/medmatix/X-Plane-Scenery) and [Flying-craft]().

Being interested in simulations, I am occupied in the updating and development of scenery for X-Plane 10+. Scenery here is in various stages of development before being submitted to the Scenery Gateway. You are welcome to download, use and improve any objects ant location scenery her but at your own risk. No warranty is implied whatso ever and these sets. 

I began using [AC3D](https://www.inivis.com/xplane.html) to build models for export, with the plugin ([ac3d_plugin_win_321r2](https://developer.x-plane.com/tools/ac3d-plugin/)) but have switched for most of my modeling to [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) and [Xplane2Blender](https://github.com/X-Plane/XPlane2Blender) plugin. Occasionally I do pre-design constructions with [FreeCAD]()https://www.freecadweb.org/. 

I believe in and support [open source software](https://opensource.org/) whenever I can.

There are a number of external library dependencies at this time; the most stable being [OpenSceneryX](https://www.opensceneryx.com/), [NAPS Library](https://www.x-plained.com/), [waves library](https://forums.x-plane.org/index.php?/files/file/25439-waves-library/) and [others](https://forums.x-plane.org/index.php?/search/&tags=library) which are poorly documented here at this time. I Thank the creators of all these libraries. In order to submit to the Scenery Gateway the objects used must be moved inside the package - which will simplify getting all the objects needed.

## SpaceX Boca Chica Build and Launch Sites

The rapid development of both infra-structure and at the Boca Chica Texas sites has left both mapping and scenery lagging well behind the current details at the site. This project starts an ongoing process to keep current on a location I have been excitedly following nearly daily. The Scenery I update still lags far behind my enthusiasm but enjoy (with the usual disclaimers) what I have completed so far. Due to the unique nature of the buildings and other structures etc., fidelity varies.

Although strictly not an airport, I have created X-Plane 11 scenery for this FAA Licensed / Designated spaceport in South Texas. The, "IATA ID" of the semi-fictitious FAA recognized facility is informally SX20. A zipped version of the most up-to-date installation is here, along with most supporting development materials (objects).

[Here](https://github.com/medmatix/XPStarbase/images/Screenshots.pdf) are screen shots of the Boca Chica area in X-Plane 11. (These in the process of bring up-dated to reflect current content).

The some truly "fictitious" areas may be included from time to time in the experimental branches, Sea Launch Platform which is a plan on record is rendered from time to time near shore. The Use of the beach area is less do-able for regulatory reasons of course.

The platform I developed last September when the "Mary - Maria Pointer" @BocaChicaMaria1 spotted a platform being renovated in the ship canal. Your guess on the ultimate configuration is as good as mine, but here is one for fun.

## SpaceX Field

A landing strip is currently included so I can takeoff and land while overflying to inspect the scenery in use.
